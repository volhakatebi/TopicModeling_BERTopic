### Topic Modeling using Transformers (BERTopic)

This project contains sample code to: 
* hydrate (i.e., extract) tweets of interest using available tweet IDs. The list of IDs was shared by [Hayawi et al. (2021)](https://github.com/sakibsh/ANTiVax/blob/main/Labeled/ids.txt) and includes COVID-19 vaccine misinformation labels.
* perform topic modeling using BERTopic approach that relies on that leverages transformers and c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.
