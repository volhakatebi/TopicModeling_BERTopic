### Topic Modeling using Transformers (BERTopic)

This project contains sample code to: 
* **hydrate (i.e., extract) tweets** of interest using available tweet IDs. The tweet ID list used for this code was shared by [Hayawi et al. (2021)](https://github.com/sakibsh/ANTiVax/blob/main/Labeled/ids.txt) and includes COVID-19 vaccine misinformation labels.
* **perform topic modeling** using [BERTopic approach] (https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) that relies on that leverages transformers and c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions
